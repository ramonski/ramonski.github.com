Finally I found what I was looking for -- a blog engine made for coders!

<!-- more -->

+ All my code and blog posts are hosted by GitHub
+ Creating a new blog post is as simple as ```rake new_post["title"]```
+ Re-Generating the markdown syntax with  ```rake watch```
+ Quick local previews with [POW](http://pow.cx)
+ Publishing is also a one liner ```rake deploy```

and finally: no more [WYSWIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWIG) Hell:)

For more info, go to: [Octopress -- A blogging framework for hackers](http://octopress.org)

Special thanx to [seletz](http://seletz.github.com) for finding this tool;)
