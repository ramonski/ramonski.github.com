**WTF VeeWee??**

*[VeeWee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee) is a tool to build
**[vagrant base boxes](http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/boxes.html)**
from scratch.*

**Why do I need this?**

*It simply saves your time by automating the complete installation process of a
[virtual box](http://www.virtualbox.org).*

**Aren't there already finished Boxes around?**

*Yes, but you don't know who or how this box was build*

**Does that mean I don't have to click anymore?**

*Yup! no more click&fun time wasting anymore!*
